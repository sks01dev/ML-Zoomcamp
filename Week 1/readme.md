## üìò Week 1 Overview

The goal of this week was to understand the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning algorithms. Key topics included:

- **Matrix Operations**: Matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
- **Linear Algebra Fundamentals**: Dot products, matrix shapes, and their relevance in ML.
- **Practical Applications**: Implementing linear algebra concepts using Python and NumPy.

## üîß Exercises and Implementations

The exercises involved:

- Computing the transpose of a matrix `X` and performing `X.T @ X`.
- Inverting the resulting matrix `(X.T @ X)^(-1)`.
- Using the inverse to solve linear equations, a fundamental step in linear regression.

## üß™ Example Problem

One of the exercises included:

1. Creating a dataset:

```python
y = [1100, 1300, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200]
````

2. Computing `X.T @ X`, inverting it, multiplying by `X.T`, and then multiplying by `y` to get the weight vector `w`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example steps
XTX = X.T @ X
XTX_inv = np.linalg.inv(XTX)
w = XTX_inv @ X.T @ y
```

3. Summing all elements of `w` to analyze the result:

```python
total_weight = np.sum(w)
print("Sum of weights:", total_weight)
```
