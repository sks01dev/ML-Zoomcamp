## Overview

This notebook demonstrates building a **lead scoring model** using the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will **convert** (sign up for a service) based on various features.

We cover:

1. Data preparation and handling missing values.
2. Feature importance using ROC AUC for numerical variables.
3. Logistic regression modeling with **one-hot encoding**.
4. Precision, recall, and F1 score analysis to select thresholds.
5. 5-fold cross-validation to check model stability.
6. Hyperparameter tuning to select the best regularization parameter.

## Key Results

- **Best numerical feature (ROC AUC):** `number_of_courses_viewed`  
- **Validation AUC:** `0.794`  
- **Threshold where precision â‰ˆ recall:** `0.59`  
- **Threshold with max F1:** `0.47`  
- **Standard deviation of AUC across folds:** `0.01`  
- **Best regularization parameter C:** `0.001`

## Lessons Learned

- ROC AUC can help identify predictive features even before modeling.
- Logistic regression combined with one-hot encoding provides a strong baseline.
- Threshold tuning is crucial for balancing precision and recall based on business needs.
- Cross-validation confirms the robustness of the model and prevents overfitting.
- Hyperparameter tuning improves model performance and reliability.
