# üöó Car Fuel Efficiency Predictor (ML Zoomcamp W2)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

This project develops a **Linear Regression model** to predict car fuel efficiency in Miles Per Gallon (`fuel_efficiency_mpg`) using a subset of car features. The primary focus is on mastering the fundamental machine learning workflow: handling missing data, proper train/validation/test splitting, and understanding model stability and regularization.

### Key Objectives:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Analyze missing values and compare imputation strategies (mean vs. zero).
* **Model Training:** Implement a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
* **Model Evaluation & Stability:** Use RMSE to evaluate model performance and assess the impact of different random seeds on model stability.
* **Regularization:** Test the effect of Ridge regularization (L2) to prevent overfitting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run this notebook, you need a standard Python environment with the following dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sks01dev/data-science-lab/](https://github.com/sks01dev/data-science-lab/)
    cd data-science-lab
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Download Data:** The dataset is fetched directly within the notebook from the official source:
    ```bash
    wget [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/car_fuel_efficiency.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/car_fuel_efficiency.csv)
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

Execute the `week_2.ipynb` notebook cell-by-cell to follow the full machine learning workflow.

1.  **Data Selection:** Only the following columns are used: `'engine_displacement'`, `'horsepower'`, `'vehicle_weight'`, `'model_year'`, and `'fuel_efficiency_mpg'`.
2.  **Splitting:** The data is shuffled (seed 42) and split into Train (60%), Validation (20%), and Test (20%) sets.
3.  **Model Comparison:** Linear Regression models are trained to compare performance after filling missing `'horsepower'` values with 0 vs. the training set mean.
4.  **Final Evaluation:** The best configuration is tested on the final, unseen test set.

## üß† Key Learnings

1.  **Imputation Strategy:** The **mean imputation** of missing `'horsepower'` values (RMSE: 0.46) significantly outperformed filling with zero (RMSE: 0.51). Using the mean preserves the feature's distribution better than using an extreme outlier (0).
2.  **Model Stability:** By testing the split sensitivity across 10 random seeds, the model was determined to be **stable** ($\text{std} \approx 0.006$), confirming the reliability of the chosen split ratio.
3.  **Regularization Impact:** Ridge regularization (L2) had a negligible effect on the final RMSE scores, suggesting the Linear Regression model was not heavily overfitting the data.

## üöÄ Future Work

* **Feature Engineering:** Engineer new features (e.g., age of car from `model_year`) to potentially improve the model's predictive power.
* **Categorical Features:** Incorporate the original categorical columns (`origin`, `fuel_type`, `drivetrain`) using one-hot encoding or other techniques.
* **Advanced Regression:** Test other models like Elastic Net or Random Forest for improved accuracy.
